# ProceduralGeometry

This project is a collection of scripts related to visualizing computer geometry.

The following is a showcase of what I worked on for Procedural Mesh Generation.

## Spirals

This was a very simple study on Spirals:

Which later on evolved to an experiment: how to generate a sphere mesh by curling stripes around an axis:

## Torus

Not soon afterwards, I decided to try and generate a Torus, this time with proper support for normals.

## Bottle/Vase Mesh Generator

This was my first slightly-comprehensive study on procedural mesh generation, the generated vase can have variable poly count, automatic UV and normal mapping (more normals details can be added via shaders) and easy access to resizing the radial or vertical axis:
